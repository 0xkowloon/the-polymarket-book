# The Polymarket Book

The Polymarket Book is a guide on Polymarket's exchange protocol. The protocol is a set of contracts that allows the creation and trading of conditional tokens under Gnosis's Conditional Token Framework (CTF) using collateral tokens (USDC). A CTF is an ERC-1155 token that splits into two opposite sides by depositing collateral tokens into the CTF contract. Each side can be traded on Polymarket separately, but when a market resolves, only the winning side will receive the original collateral amount.
